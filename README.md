Urban farming is gaining popularity as people increasingly seek sustainable ways to grow food 
in limited spaces. However, access to affordable and reliable smart irrigation systems and urban 
farming tools remains limited, especially for beginners and hobbyists. This project aims to bridge 
that gap by developing a web-based platform using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, 
React.js, Node.js) that allows users to explore, purchase, and learn about smart farming pots 
designed specifically for urban use. 
The platform provides a user-friendly interface for browsing products, viewing detailed 
descriptions, and placing orders. It includes features such as user registration, authentication, 
product filtering, cart management, and order tracking. The admin panel supports product 
uploads, stock updates, and order management. The system is scalable and secure, using 
JWT-based authentication, RESTful APIs, and a NoSQL database (MongoDB) for efficient data 
handling. 
This project not only demonstrates full-stack web development using modern JavaScript 
technologies but also supports the broader goal of promoting smart, space-efficient farming 
practices in urban areas. It serves as a practical solution to connect eco-conscious consumers 
with accessible urban farming tools and highlights the potential of digital platforms in advancing 
sustainable agriculture.
